# SimplestMathProblem
This is a console application that will calculate the simplest math problem for you with any given parameter. Basically it's a big function.
It can also write all the values that it calculates into a file, it just might take a bit more time to do so given your writing speeds for your drive.

## Here's how the whole thing works:
- You take any natural number (it only works with integers)
- If it's even, divide it by 2
- If it's odd, multiply by 3 and add 1
- Take the result of those steps and repeat the cycle
- Eventually you're supposed to hit an endless loop of 4, 2, 1
- That's when you know you're done calculating all the values.
